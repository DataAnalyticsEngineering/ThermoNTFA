Eulerian Parameter Inference (EPI) is a powerful and novel method for inverse model parameter inference. The eulerpi package provides an implementation of the EPI algorithm, which takes observed data and a model as input and returns a parameter distribution consistent with the observed data by solving the inverse problem directly. In case the model describes a one-to-one mapping between parameters and simulation results, the inferred parameter distribution is the true underlying distribution.
