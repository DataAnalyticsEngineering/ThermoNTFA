Thermo-Plastic Nonuniform Transformation Field Analysis

Features
^^^^^^^^

- The **ThermoNTFA** acts as a reduced order model (ROM) and approximates the effective behavior of composite materials that consist of thermoelastic and thermoplastic constituents.
- The material parameters of all constituents are allowed to depend strongly on the temperature.
- This temperature-dependence is reflected in the ROM that is based on interpolated space-saving tabular data at arbitrarily many temperature points.
- Possible application: Eigenstress Analysis of Laser Dispersed Materials
